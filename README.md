# JDBCLibraryManager
Educational project developed to practice the use of JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) and the DAO (Data Access Object) pattern in a simple library management system.

The system performs basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on entities such as books and authors, providing hands-on experience with data access structure in Java applications.
